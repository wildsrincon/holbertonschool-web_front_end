## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### OSI Model

- What it is
- How many layers it has
- How it is organized

### What is a LAN

- Typical usage
- Typical geographical size

### What is a WAN

- Typical usage
- Typical geographical size

### What is the Internet

- What is an IP address
- What are the 2 types of IP address
- What is localhost
- What is a subnet
- Why IPv6 was created

### TCP/UDP

- What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
- What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
- What is a port
- Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
- What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

## Requirements

### General :minidisc:

## More Info

The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

For multiple choice question type tasks, just type the number of the correct answer in your answer file, add a new line for every new answer, example:

What is the most important position in a software company?

1. Project manager
2. Backend developer
3. System administrator

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ cat foo_answer_file
3
sylvain@ubuntu$
```
